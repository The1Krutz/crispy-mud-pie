# Crispy Mud Pie

A little project of mine to create a turn-based tactics game on a hex grid.

## Inspirations:

*  Item 1

*  Item 2

*  Item 3

    *  Item 3a
    
    *  Item 3b
    
    *  Item 3c

- Battletech (the HBS game but also the OG tabletop game)

  - Tactics on a hex grid

- Aurora 4X

  - "what if you took the combat from D&D and scaled it up to have battles the size of Rome: Total War, but kept the granularity of D&D combat?"

  - "what if you took the combat from HBS battletech, but did it fast enough that a game with 8v8 didn't make me want to cry in real life? And then do it with 100v100."
